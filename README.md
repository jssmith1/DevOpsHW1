###Service (EC2)
AWS supports many services, including Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). EC2 provides expandable computing capacity. It enables you to create a virtual machine on an Amazon server. Depending on your needs, you can specify different operating systems or software packages to include. Additionally, you pay based on how much storage or computing capacity you need. It enables you to quickly build scalable applications.

###Simple Program
Based on [examples](https://github.ncsu.edu/jssmit11/DevOpsHW1/blob/master/src/Requests.java "examples") from the Java AWS SDK, I created a [simple java program](https://github.ncsu.edu/jssmit11/DevOpsHW1/blob/master/src/CreateInstance.java "simple java program") for connecting to EC2 and creating a small linux instance. I have also included a [screenshot](https://github.ncsu.edu/jssmit11/DevOpsHW1/blob/master/HW1.PNG "screenshot") that shows the successfully created instance.
